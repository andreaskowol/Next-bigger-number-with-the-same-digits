## Next bigger number with the same digit

### Description

Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next bigger number that can be formed by rearranging its digits. For example:

For example:

```
12 ==> 21
513 ==> 531
2017 ==> 2071
```

If the digits can't be rearranged to form a bigger number, return `-1`

```
9 ==> -1
111 ==> -1
531 ==> -1
```

- some tests will include very large numbers.
- test data only employs positive integers.
